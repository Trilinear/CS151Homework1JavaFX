The base of this file was taken from Keepingshtum/CS151JavaFXExamples1 and modified to fit the structure of HW1.
In particular, pom.xml was modified to have the appropriate mainClass, the folder directories are the same because they were messy to work with
when I tried to make a completely new folder structure, and the .fxml files were changed to fit the needs for HW1.

I decided to combine the text input box from Examples 1 and pass on an integer to some animations from Example 3.
